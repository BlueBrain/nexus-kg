# KnowledgeGraph

The service is the heart of the BlueBrain Nexus platform. It allows users to define their domain, populate the
knowledge graph with data, attach files to data.  It also provides semantic search facilities to discover similar and
relevant data in the platform.

The @ref:[API Reference](api-reference/index.md) describes the exposed interface, while the
@ref:[Service Internals](internals/index.md) describes the general design of the service.
