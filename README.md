# Nexus KG Service

The project bundles the collection of modules that make up the Nexus KG Service.

## Building the project

The project depends on the [sbt nexus](https://github.com/bluebrain/sbt-nexus) plugin and
[nexus-commons](https://github.com/bluebrain/nexus-commons).  Until stable versions of these dependencies are released,
in order to build the project, these dependencies need to be published locally.

## The service API

Please refer to the [published documentation](https://bbp-nexus.epfl.ch/dev/docs/kg).
